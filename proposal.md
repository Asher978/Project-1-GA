 # Ping Pong - Proposal


## What is Ping Pong?
**PingPong** is a two-player game inspired out of tennis. Usually played on a table. Rackets are wooden and the ball id plastic. Tennis like inspired. Some say this game originated from China and some disagree. 

### Taken from Google:
Ping-pong diplomacy (Chinese: 乒乓外交 Pīngpāng wàijiāo) refers to the exchange of table tennis (ping-pong) players between the United States and People's Republic of China (PRC) in the early 1970s. The event marked a thaw in Sino-American relations that paved the way to a visit to Beijing by President Richard Nixon.

I picked this game as it presents a challenge to figure out the logic behind object collisions. My learning objective behind this is to strengthen my knowledge on the material that has been presented to me in last 2 weeks.

## Initial thoughts on game structure

* Movement of the ball
* Logic / Algoritham behind collision 
  *  collision of the ball to the top and bottom walls 
  *  collision of the ball to the left and right paddle
  *  setting boundries so the ball and the paddles do not go out of the game space/box
* Using localStorage to keep scores
* Setting win conditions
* Adding sounds
## Phases of Completion
